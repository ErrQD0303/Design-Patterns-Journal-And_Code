# 🧱 Design Pattern Journal — 2025-10-17 2025-10-18 Day 01-02: Creational Pattern:Builder

**Pattern:** Builder
**Category:** Creational

---

## 🧩 1. Pattern Overview

**Intent:**

> The Builder Pattern seperates the construction of an object from its class
> Allows the same construction process to create different representations
> Removes complex constructors with more than one optional parameter
> Make the developer easily create an object of a class without making mistakes

**Summary:**

> The Builder Pattern allow you to construct an object of a complex class
> step by step by using a seperate Builder Object and an optional Director Object.
> The Director Object is the class defines the order in which to execute the building
> steps
> while the Builder Object is responsible for the implementation of those building
> steps.

---

## 🌍 2. Real-World Analogy

> The Director is the civil engineer who designs the blueprint of a house
> The Builder is the construction worker who builds the house step by step
> following the blueprint
> The Product is the house that is being built

## 💻 3. UML / Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace RefactoringGuru.DesignPatterns.Builder.Conceptual
{
    // The Builder interface specifies methods for creating the different parts
    // of the Product objects.
    public interface IBuilder
    {
        void BuildPartA();

        void BuildPartB();

        void BuildPartC();
    }

    // The Concrete Builder classes follow the Builder interface and provide
    // specific implementations of the building steps. Your program may have
    // several variations of Builders, implemented differently.
    public class ConcreteBuilder : IBuilder
    {
        private Product _product = new Product();

        // A fresh builder instance should contain a blank product object, which
        // is used in further assembly.
        public ConcreteBuilder()
        {
            this.Reset();
        }

        public void Reset()
        {
            this._product = new Product();
        }

        // All production steps work with the same product instance.
        public void BuildPartA()
        {
            this._product.Add("PartA1");
        }

        public void BuildPartB()
        {
            this._product.Add("PartB1");
        }

        public void BuildPartC()
        {
            this._product.Add("PartC1");
        }

        // Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for
        // retrieving results. That's because various types of builders may
        // create entirely different products that don't follow the same
        // interface. Therefore, such methods cannot be declared in the base
        // Builder interface (at least in a statically typed programming
        // language).
        //
        // Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        // instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
        // That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end
        // of the `GetProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not
        // mandatory, and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset
        // call from the client code before disposing of the previous result.
        public Product GetProduct()
        {
            Product result = this._product;

            this.Reset();

            return result;
        }
    }

    // It makes sense to use the Builder pattern only when your products are
    // quite complex and require extensive configuration.
    //
    // Unlike in other creational patterns, different concrete builders can
    // produce unrelated products. In other words, results of various builders
    // may not always follow the same interface.
    public class Product
    {
        private List<object> _parts = new List<object>();

        public void Add(string part)
        {
            this._parts.Add(part);
        }

        public string ListParts()
        {
            string str = string.Empty;

            for (int i = 0; i < this._parts.Count; i++)
            {
                str += this._parts[i] + ", ";
            }

            str = str.Remove(str.Length - 2); // removing last ",c"

            return "Product parts: " + str + "\n";
        }
    }

    // The Director is only responsible for executing the building steps in a
    // particular sequence. It is helpful when producing products according to a
    // specific order or configuration. Strictly speaking, the Director class is
    // optional, since the client can control builders directly.
    public class Director
    {
        private IBuilder _builder;

        public IBuilder Builder
        {
            set { _builder = value; }
        }

        // The Director can construct several product variations using the same
        // building steps.
        public void BuildMinimalViableProduct()
        {
            this._builder.BuildPartA();
        }

        public void BuildFullFeaturedProduct()
        {
            this._builder.BuildPartA();
            this._builder.BuildPartB();
            this._builder.BuildPartC();
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The client code creates a builder object, passes it to the
            // director and then initiates the construction process. The end
            // result is retrieved from the builder object.
            var director = new Director();
            var builder = new ConcreteBuilder();
            director.Builder = builder;

            Console.WriteLine("Standard basic product:");
            director.BuildMinimalViableProduct();
            Console.WriteLine(builder.GetProduct().ListParts());

            Console.WriteLine("Standard full featured product:");
            director.BuildFullFeaturedProduct();
            Console.WriteLine(builder.GetProduct().ListParts());

            // Remember, the Builder pattern can be used without a Director
            // class.
            Console.WriteLine("Custom product:");
            builder.BuildPartA();
            builder.BuildPartC();
            Console.Write(builder.GetProduct().ListParts());
